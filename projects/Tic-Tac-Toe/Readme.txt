Assalamu Alaikum Sir,
I know its a simple project but it’s my habit to provide a readme file
with any code or app that I build and provide to others.
Please consider sir.
=================================================
instructions:

in this game, players can choose whether they want
to play with pc or with human

press 1 and press enter to play with pc

press 2 and press enter to play with another
friend

and inside this game player will find a side gameboard
to guide them to play a valid move
=========================================================
I tried to make it a little bit furnished
but for limitation, it won’t be that much pretty
but it was an outcome of what I have learned from
my university 1st year.
I hope you would enjoy
thank you, sir 
Assalamu Alaikum.
